# Image Classification

This project focuses on the process of image classification, which involves categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors in an image according to specific rules. The classification model is trained using TensorFlow.

## Dataset Used

The dataset used in this project is the Fashion MNIST Dataset, which is an advanced version of the traditional MNIST dataset. Unlike the original MNIST dataset that contains images of handwritten numbers (0, 1, 2, etc.), the Fashion MNIST dataset includes images of various clothing items. This dataset serves as an excellent benchmark for testing image classification models.

## Project Overview

- **Task**: Image classification using TensorFlow.
- **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST.
- **Goal**: To classify images of clothing based on their spectral and textural characteristics.
- - **Notebooks**:
  - **Image_Classification_architecture1.ipynb**: This notebook contains the first model for image classification.
  - **Image_Classification_architecture1.ipynb**: This notebook uses an alternative architecture for the image classification task, demonstrating a different approach to improving model performance.
